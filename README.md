# Data Analyzer

This is a simple C program that reads a dataset of integers from a file and computes the average. It is designed for datasets like the weights of elephant seals, where the number of entries may not be known in advance.

## Features

- Dynamically allocates memory for the dataset, resizing as needed.
- Reads integers from a file separated by spaces, tabs, or newlines.
- Computes and prints the average of all the numbers in the dataset.
- Handles large datasets efficiently without predefined array sizes.

## File Requirements

- Input file should contain integers separated by spaces, tabs, or newlines.
- Example format in `data` file:
